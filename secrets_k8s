Hereâ€™s how you can create a Kubernetes TLS secret with a custom name:

Ensure you have the TLS files:
Make sure you have your tls.crt and tls.key files in the current directory.

Create the secret with a custom name:
Use the kubectl create secret tls command and specify your custom name. For example, to create a secret named my-custom-tls-secret:

sh
Copy code
kubectl create secret tls my-custom-tls-secret --cert=path/to/tls.crt --key=path/to/tls.key

Replace my-custom-tls-secret with the name you want to give to your secret, and replace path/to/tls.crt and path/to/tls.key with the actual paths to your certificate and key files.

Verify the Secret
After creating the secret, you can verify that it has been created correctly by describing it:


kubectl describe secret custom-tls-secret
